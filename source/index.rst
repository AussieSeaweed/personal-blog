My name is Juho, and I'm a final-year undergrad at the University of Toronto and an incoming PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. My `CV <https://github.com/AussieSeaweed/personal-cv/releases/latest/download/main.pdf>`_, `GitHub <https://github.com/AussieSeaweed>`_, `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHbLHD0AAAAJ>`_, `website (this site) <https://juhokim.net/>`_, `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/aussieseaweed/>`_, and `email <mailto:juho-kim@outlook.com>`_ can be accessed from `my landing page <https://aussieseaweed.com>`_.

I enjoy writing code, especially in (computational) game theory and computer games (mostly poker). I'm also really interested in topics of symbolic computation and (parts of) software engineering.

Other than that, I like to play video games, listen to classical music, watch anime, and read about politics, history, and philosophy. I'm a proficient player of the piano and clarinet. Fluent in English and Korean, I'm currently learning French, Japanese, and Hanja.

Most of my work and writings are open-source and/or available publicly (see `GitHub <https://github.com/AussieSeaweed>`_ and `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHbLHD0AAAAJ>`_).

I found that I had to seldom omit interesting details or personal stories in my publications due to formality. I plan on using this website to write about them in addition to other random topics.

If you have any questions about my work (e.g., `PokerKit <https://github.com/uoftcprg/pokerkit>`_) or interesting things to share, feel free to reach out to me `via email <mailto:juho-kim@outlook.com>`_!
